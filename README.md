**Bird Strike Prediction Project**

Bird strikes pose a significant threat to flight safety, causing damages estimated at millions of dollars annually and endangering human lives. This project aims to analyze bird strike incidents involving military, commercial, or civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, using data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The dataset includes incident details such as date, aircraft information, airport location, species involved, and damage caused.

Dataset:
The dataset contains records of reported wildlife strikes involving aircraft, including incident date, aircraft operator, make and model, engine details, airport location, species involved, and aircraft damage.

Approach:

Data Exploration: Analyze the FAA dataset to understand patterns and trends in bird strike incidents.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features to predict aircraft type and damage caused by bird strikes.

Model Development: Train machine learning models using the provided data to predict bird strike outcomes with a 95% confidence level.

Evaluation: Assess model performance and accuracy in predicting aircraft type and damage.
